	"$surfaceprop" "metal"				//This command tells the game to use the material type you entered. "Most used are (default, rock, metal, wood, grass, dirt, sand, water, etc...) 
	"$envmap" "env_cubemap"				//This command tells the game to use a reflection from the generated cube map of the map you are playing on. (good for reflections on your model)

	"$model" "1"					//Tells if the texture is for a model or not.
	"$translucent" "1"					//Makes your texture translucent (works with your alpha channel on your diffuse texture "can't be used with selfillium")

		//These commands can only be used when phong is available:

	"$phongwarptexture"  "Boba_Fett/shaders/phongwarp"	//This will use the phongwarp, this is a shader first seen in EP2 on the hunter (that green stuff) you can do much cool things with colors and other stuff, works really great with normal maps and phong.
	"$lightwarptexture"      "Boba_Fett/shaders/lightwarp"	//This command will use a lightwarp texture (can be gray scaled or colored) to give the model a more shadow effect or color effect when you make this texture.
	"$halflambert" "1"					//If turned on you can experience a great quality result being in-game.

		//These commands need phong enabled:

	"$rimlight" "1"					//This enables rimlight.
	"$rimlightexponent" "22"				//This will tell how much the rimlight affects the model.
	"$rimlightboost" "0.2"				//This controls the master brightness of the rimlight effect.
