# Installation Guide

As this is a fork, the [original installation guide](https://github.com/RafaelDeJongh/cap/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md) doesn't apply. Instead, please follow the new guide below.

## Stargate

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/conspiracy-servers/stargate/releases/latest/download/stargate.zip) of the addon (please don't clone or download a ZIP of the repository as changes made directly to the repository can unstable).
2. Open up the zipped archive using your preferred archive utility (WinRAR, 7-Zip, etc)
3. Create a new folder inside your Garry's Mod addons folder (check the [sidenotes](#sidenotes) for where this folder is on your system).
4. Extract the contents of the zipped archive into the folder you just created.

Once these steps are completed, you can close your archiving utility and delete the `stargate.zip` file. If you haven't installed [Wiremod](#wiremod) or [Spacebuild](#spacebuild), please proceed to those steps below.

## Wiremod

The simplest way to install Wiremod is to subscribe to it on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=160250458). However, if you wish to have the latest updates then you should download the [latest version](https://github.com/wiremod/wire/releases/latest/) from GitHub, the installation is similar to [Stargate](#stargate).

## Spacebuild

The simplest way to install Spacebuild is to subscribe to it on the [Steam Workshop](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=693838486). However, that version is known to be very out of date so it's **highly recommended** for you to download the [latest repository version](https://github.com/spacebuild/spacebuild/archive/master.zip) and install that similarly to how you installed [Stargate](#stargate).

## Sidenotes
* The [CAP Resources](https://github.com/RafaelDeJongh/cap_resources) & [CAP Fonts](https://github.com/RafaelDeJongh/cap_fonts) addons are merged with this one, so there's no need to download them separately anymore.
* If you want to have more fun with Spacebuild, you can install the Spacebuild Enhancement Pack ([Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=695227522), [GitHub](https://github.com/spacebuild/sbep)).
* Wiremod is required for this addon to function correctly, however Spacebuild isn't.
* The default Garry's Mod addons folder on Windows is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons`.
* The default Garry's Mod addons folder on Linux is either `~/.local/Steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons`, or `~/.steam/steam/SteamApps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons` depending on your distro.
