# Stargate

## What is this?
This is a fork of [Carter's Addon Pack](https://github.com/RafaelDeJongh/cap), a popular addon for [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/). It adds lots of content from the original Stargate movie, [Stargate: SG-1](https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Stargate_SG-1), [Stargate: Atlantis](https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Stargate:_Atlantis) and lastly [Stargate: Universe](https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Stargate_Universe) TV shows by MGM to the game, along with a few extra features here and there. This addon provides the greatest elements of Stargate for Garry's Mod allowing for much more diversity, creativity and fun within the game! Whether that be for building, scene creating, roleplaying, etc. It covers many themes found in the shows such as Lantean technology, Asgard technology, Wraith technology and many others, of course without forgetting the devices and weapons seen in the shows which often became deadly threats or powerful assets to the people of Stargate Command, Atlantis and Destiny.

## Why am I doing this?
As [the Carter Addon Pack's team said on their wiki page](https://github.com/RafaelDeJongh/cap/wiki#the-future-and-end-of-cap), their team has more or less abandoned the addon and it rarely recieves regular updates now, so I hope to continue it as much as I can. I love CAP, it's community and all it is so I hope with my contributions and changes I can help bring back some life into this addon and it's community :D.

## How do I use this?
Check out the [installation guide](https://github.com/conspiracy-servers/stargate/wiki/Installation-Guide) on the wiki for assistance with downloading & installing the addon from either GitHub or the Steam Workshop.

We love hearing thoughts from other developers and like minded individuals :D

## Where can I get support?
Got a question or something you feel needs to be asked? Feel free to message me by any means appropriate, I'm best available on my [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/viral32111) account. However, please check the [F.A.Q](https://github.com/conspiracy-servers/stargate/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) first to see if your question has already been answered.

## Who can I thank for this?
Without a doubt, we all owe it to the original Carter's Addon Pack Team for the code, concepts, ideas, designs, models, sounds and so, so much more. I've tried my best to find all of the people that have helped contribute to this addon and mentioned them on the [the credits page](https://github.com/conspiracy-servers/stargate/wiki/Contributor-Credits) on the wiki. Without them, none of this would've been possible and the CAP community would never have been born. Just to reiterate, I didn't create this addon or start it up, I'm only trying to bring new life back to CAP.
