# The Stargate Carter Pack

Stargate Carter Pack more commonly known as Carter's Addon Pack or CAP is an addon for Garry's mod that adds new content elements to the game, all based off the Stargate franchise from the 1994 film to the late Stargate Universe. Carter's Addon Pack gives the most impressive array of Stargate elements for Garry's Mod, allowing much more diversity & variations for Stargate gameplay in Garry's Mod.

CAP (Carter's Addon Pack) covers many themes found in Stargate, such as Lantean technology, Asgard technology and many others, without forgetting the devices and weapons found and seen in the Stargate shows, which often became deadly threats or powerful assets to the people of Stargate Command, Atlantis and Destiny.

From piloting starships to building bases, the Stargate Carter Pack provides players with great replayability, creativity, and more!
